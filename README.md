# Drowsiness Detection of Drivers using Machine Learning Algorithms
Artificial Intelligence (CSE3013) J Component
## 

● We have used OpenCV for gathering the images from the webcam and feeding them into a Deep Learning model that will classify whether the driver’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The approach we have used for the project is as follows:\
	&emsp;&emsp;Step 1 – Take the image as input from a camera.\
	&emsp;&emsp;Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest (ROI).\
	&emsp;&emsp;Step 3 – Detect the eyes from ROI and feed them to the classifier.\
	&emsp;&emsp;Step 4 – The classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.\
	&emsp;&emsp;Step 5 – Calculate the score to check whether the driver is drowsy.\
● The model architecture file is used to classify if a person’s eye is open or closed. Download it from the link below and then save it under the "models/" folder before executing the file.\
